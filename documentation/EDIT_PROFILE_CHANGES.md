# Edit Profile View Changes

## Summary of Changes

The Edit Profile View has been revamped to meet the specified requirements. The following changes have been made:

1. Created a new `edit_profile.py` file with the following features:
   - Uses candidate email as the primary identifier (removed Candidate ID logic)
   - Displays and allows updates for:
     - Candidate Name (editable)
     - Candidate Email (non-editable)
     - CV Status (Uploaded/Not Uploaded)
     - Interview Status (non-editable, synced with Interview tab)
     - Google Form fields in exact order (editable except Timestamp/Email)
     - Resume link editable (if missing, allows upload)
   - Removed Interview Notes section
   - Added debug output to the terminal

2. Updated `receptionist.py` to use the new `edit_profile` function for the "Edit Candidate" option.

## Implementation Details

### Data Flow

The implementation maintains the existing data flow:
- Candidate data is pulled from Google Sheets (primary source)
- Updates are saved to Firestore
- Resume URLs point to files in Google Drive

### Debug Output

The implementation includes debug output in the terminal:
- When loading candidate data, it displays the data source and available fields
- When saving changes, it displays the updated fields and their previous values

### User Interface

The user interface has been simplified and focused on the required fields:
- Basic Info section with name, email, CV status, and interview status
- Form Details section with all Google Form fields in order
- Resume section with the ability to edit the resume link or upload a new resume

## Testing

The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- All requirements are met
- Edge cases are handled (missing resume, etc.)
- The UI is user-friendly and intuitive

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements could include:
- Direct integration with Google Drive API for resume uploads
- Better validation of form fields
- More sophisticated resume preview capabilities
