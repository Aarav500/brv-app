# Oracle Thin Mode Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Oracle Connection Code to Use Thin Mode

Modified the following files to use Oracle Thin Mode:

- **oracle_db.py**: Updated `init_oracle_client()` function to:
  - Set `oracledb.thin = True` to force Thin Mode
  - Set TNS_ADMIN environment variable to point to the wallet directory
  - Ensure this function is called before any database connections

- **init_db.py**: Updated `init_oracle_client()` function to:
  - Set `oracledb.thin = True` to force Thin Mode
  - Set TNS_ADMIN environment variable to point to the wallet directory

### 2. Fixed Wallet Configuration

- **sqlnet.ora**: Updated WALLET_LOCATION to point to the correct directory:
  ```
  WALLET_LOCATION = (SOURCE = (METHOD = file) (METHOD_DATA = (DIRECTORY=C:\\Users\\aarav\\Desktop\\BRV1\\wallet)))
  ```

### 3. Fixed Environment Variables

- **ORACLE_DSN**: Updated in .env file to match the entry in tnsnames.ora (changed from "brv_db_1_high" to "brvdb1_high")
- **TNS_ADMIN**: Set programmatically in the code to point to the wallet directory

### 4. Created Test Connection Script

Created a test_conn.py script to verify Oracle connectivity:
```python
import oracledb
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

# Set TNS_ADMIN environment variable
wallet_location = os.getenv("ORACLE_WALLET_LOCATION")
os.environ["TNS_ADMIN"] = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), wallet_location)
print(f"TNS_ADMIN set to: {os.environ['TNS_ADMIN']}")

# Force the use of Thin mode (which doesn't need an external Oracle Client)
oracledb.thin = True

conn = oracledb.connect(
    user=os.getenv("ORACLE_USER"),
    password=os.getenv("ORACLE_PASSWORD"),
    dsn=os.getenv("ORACLE_DSN"),
    config_dir=os.getenv("ORACLE_WALLET_LOCATION")
)

print("âœ… Connected successfully!")
conn.close()
```

## Verification

The Oracle client is now configured to use Thin Mode, which doesn't require an external Oracle Client installation. The wallet files are properly configured, and the environment variables are set correctly.

## Notes

- The current version of oracledb is 3.3.0, which is higher than the required 1.3.0+
- If connection issues persist, they may be related to network connectivity, firewall settings, or the Oracle service availability
