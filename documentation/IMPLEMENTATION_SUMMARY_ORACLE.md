## Overview

The BRV Applicant Management System has been migrated from a combination of Firebase, Planetscale (MySQL), and SQLite to Oracle Cloud Autonomous Database (Always Free Tier). This migration centralizes all data storage in Oracle Cloud while maintaining Google Drive integration for resume storage.

### Key Benefits

- **Centralized Data Storage**: All data (users, candidates, interviews) now stored in Oracle Cloud
- **Improved Security**: Implemented bcrypt password hashing for user authentication
- **Auto-Scaling**: Automatic database creation when storage reaches 90% capacity
- **Simplified Architecture**: Removed dependencies on multiple database systems
- **Maintained Functionality**: Preserved all existing features while improving the backend

## Core Components

The migration involved creating several new core components:

### 1. Oracle Database Connection (oracle_db.py)

This module provides the core functionality for connecting to Oracle Autonomous Database:

- Secure connection using Oracle wallet
- Connection pooling for efficiency
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Query execution functions

### 2. Environment Configuration (env_config.py)

This module centralizes all configuration management:

- Environment variable loading and validation
- Database configuration management
- Credential management for Oracle and Google Drive
- Storage usage tracking

### 3. User Authentication (user_auth.py)

This module handles all user authentication and management:

- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- User retrieval, creation, and management functions
- Password expiration and reset functionality
- Role-based access control

### 4. Candidate Management (oracle_candidates.py)

This module manages all candidate data:

- CRUD operations for candidates
- UUID generation for candidate IDs
- Comprehensive search functionality
- Interview status management

### 5. Google Drive Integration (google_drive.py)

This module maintains integration with Google Drive for resume storage:

- Resume upload, download, and deletion
- Google Drive folder management
- Resume link extraction and management
- Compatibility with the existing API

### 6. Database Auto-Scaling (db_auto_scaling.py)

This module implements the database auto-scaling functionality:

- Storage usage monitoring
- Automatic database creation
- Query routing across multiple databases
- Configuration management for multiple databases

## Database Schema

The Oracle database schema includes the following tables:

### Users Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id VARCHAR2(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR2(100) UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR2(255) UNIQUE,
    password_hash VARCHAR2(255),
    role VARCHAR2(50),
    last_password_change TIMESTAMP,
    force_password_reset NUMBER(1)
);
```

### Candidates Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE candidates (
    candidate_id VARCHAR2(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    full_name VARCHAR2(255),
    email VARCHAR2(255),
    phone VARCHAR2(20),
    additional_phone VARCHAR2(20),
    dob DATE,
    caste VARCHAR2(50),
    sub_caste VARCHAR2(50),
    marital_status VARCHAR2(50),
    qualification VARCHAR2(100),
    work_experience VARCHAR2(100),
    referral VARCHAR2(255),
    resume_link VARCHAR2(500),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    interview_status VARCHAR2(50)
);
```

### Interviews Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE interviews (
    interview_id VARCHAR2(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    candidate_id VARCHAR2(36),
    interviewer_id VARCHAR2(36),
    scheduled_time TIMESTAMP,
    feedback CLOB,
    status VARCHAR2(50),
    result VARCHAR2(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    CONSTRAINT fk_candidate
        FOREIGN KEY (candidate_id)
        REFERENCES candidates(candidate_id),
    CONSTRAINT fk_interviewer
        FOREIGN KEY (interviewer_id)
        REFERENCES users(user_id)
);
```

### Settings Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE settings (
    key VARCHAR2(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    value CLOB,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Authentication System

The authentication system has been completely redesigned to use Oracle Database and bcrypt for password hashing:

### Key Features

- **Secure Password Hashing**: All passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- **UUID for User IDs**: Each user has a unique UUID
- **Password Expiration**: Passwords expire after a configurable period (default: 30 days)
- **Force Password Reset**: Administrators can force users to reset their passwords
- **Role-Based Access**: Different roles (CEO, interviewer, receptionist) have different access levels

### Authentication Flow

1. User enters username/email and password
2. System retrieves user from Oracle database
3. Password is verified using bcrypt
4. If password is correct, system checks if password reset is required
5. If reset is required, user is redirected to password reset page
6. Otherwise, user is authenticated and granted access based on role

## Candidate Management

The candidate management system has been updated to use Oracle Database:

### Key Features

- **UUID for Candidate IDs**: Each candidate has a unique UUID
- **Comprehensive Search**: Search candidates by name, email, phone, or interview status
- **Resume Integration**: Seamless integration with Google Drive for resume storage
- **Interview Tracking**: Track interview status and feedback

### Candidate Data Flow

1. Candidate fills out form or receptionist enters data
2. System generates UUID for the candidate
3. Data is stored in Oracle database
4. If resume is uploaded, it's stored in Google Drive and the link is saved in the database
5. Candidate can be searched by name or email
6. Interview status can be updated as the candidate progresses through the process

## Resume Storage

Resume storage continues to use Google Drive, but with improved integration with Oracle Database:

### Key Features

- **Google Drive Storage**: All resumes are stored in Google Drive
- **Automatic Folder Creation**: Creates a folder if it doesn't exist
- **Resume Link Storage**: Links are stored in the Oracle database
- **Resume Download**: Resumes can be downloaded directly from the application

### Resume Upload Flow

1. User selects a resume file to upload
2. System uploads the file to Google Drive
3. Google Drive returns a link to the file
4. Link is stored in the Oracle database associated with the candidate
5. Resume can be accessed later by retrieving the link from the database

## Auto-Scaling Functionality

The auto-scaling functionality automatically creates new databases when the current one reaches 90% capacity:

### Key Features

- **Storage Monitoring**: Regularly checks database storage usage
- **Threshold Detection**: Detects when storage reaches 90% capacity
- **Automatic Database Creation**: Creates a new database when needed
- **Query Routing**: Routes writes to the latest database and reads across all databases
- **Configuration Management**: Tracks all databases in a configuration file

### Auto-Scaling Flow

1. System monitors storage usage of all databases
2. When a database reaches 90% capacity, a new database is created
3. The new database is initialized with the same schema
4. The configuration is updated to include the new database
5. New writes are directed to the new database
6. Reads are performed across all databases to ensure all data is accessible

## Removed Components

The following components have been removed or replaced:

- **Firebase Authentication**: Replaced with Oracle-based authentication
- **Firestore Database**: Replaced with Oracle tables
- **Planetscale/MySQL**: Replaced with Oracle database
- **SQLite Fallback**: Removed in favor of Oracle-only approach

## Dependencies

The following dependencies have been added or updated:

- **oracledb**: For connecting to Oracle Autonomous Database
- **bcrypt**: For secure password hashing
- **python-dotenv**: For environment variable management

The following dependencies have been removed:

- **mysql-connector-python**: No longer needed with Oracle migration
- **firebase-admin**: No longer needed with Oracle migration

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the Oracle Cloud implementation:

1. **Data Migration Tool**: Create a tool to migrate existing data from Firebase/MySQL to Oracle
2. **Backup and Restore**: Implement automated backup and restore functionality
3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize queries and connection pooling for better performance
4. **Advanced Monitoring**: Add more detailed monitoring of database performance and usage
5. **Oracle Cloud API Integration**: Fully automate database creation using Oracle Cloud API
