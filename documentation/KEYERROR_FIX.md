# KeyError Fix Documentation

## Issue Description

The application was encountering a `KeyError: 1` error when trying to access candidate data in the receptionist.py file. This error occurred because the code was trying to access elements using list indexing (e.g., `candidate[1]`), but the candidate object was actually a dictionary with keys like 'Candidate Name', 'Email', etc.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated List Indexing to Dictionary Access

All instances of list indexing in receptionist.py were updated to use dictionary access with the get() method, which provides a safer way to access dictionary values with default fallbacks:

- `candidate[1]` → `candidate.get('Candidate Name', 'Unknown')`
- `candidate[2]` → `candidate.get('Email', 'Unknown')`
- `candidate[3]` → `candidate.get('Phone', 'Unknown')`
- `candidate[4]` → `candidate.get('Address', 'Unknown')`
- `candidate[6]` → `candidate.get('hr_data')`
- `candidate[7]` → `candidate.get('resume_path')`
- `candidate[8]` → `candidate.get('Interview Status', 'Pending')`

### 2. Enhanced HR Data Handling

The code for handling HR data was improved to properly handle both string and dictionary formats:

```python
if candidate.get('hr_data'):  # hr_data field
    try:
        if isinstance(candidate.get('hr_data'), str):
            hr_data = json.loads(candidate.get('hr_data'))
        else:
            hr_data = candidate.get('hr_data', {})
        # ...
    except:
        st.warning("Could not parse HR data")
```

### 3. Updated Candidate Lookup

The candidate lookup by email was updated to use dictionary access:

```python
candidate = next((c for c in candidates if c.get('Email') == selected_email), None)
```

## Testing

A test script (`test_receptionist_fix.py`) was created to verify that dictionary access works correctly for candidate data. The test script simulates the behavior in receptionist.py and confirms that:

1. We can access the candidate's name, email, and other fields using get() with default values
2. We can check for the presence of a resume path to determine CV status
3. We can access the interview status
4. We can access and iterate through HR data

The test script ran successfully, confirming that the changes should resolve the KeyError issue.

## Additional Changes

As part of the ongoing effort to remove candidate_id references from the application, several other changes were made:

1. Removed the Candidate ID Panel from receptionist.py
2. Removed Interview Notes from the Reception View
3. Updated firebase_candidates.py to use email or application_id instead of candidate_id
4. Updated utility functions in utils.py and utils_update.py to use more generic identifiers

These changes align with the previous work to revamp the Edit Profile View and remove candidate_id logic from the application.

## Conclusion

The KeyError issue has been fixed by updating the code to use dictionary access instead of list indexing. This change makes the code more robust and less prone to errors when the structure of the candidate data changes. The application should now work correctly with the new data structure.
