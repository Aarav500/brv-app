GitHub Repository Setup Instructions:

1. Go to https://github.com/Aarav500
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter "brv-app" as the repository name
4. Keep it as a public repository (or select private if you prefer)
5. Do not initialize with README, .gitignore, or license as we already have our files ready
6. Click "Create repository"

After creating the repository, run the following commands in your terminal to add the remote repository and push your code:

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/Aarav500/brv-app.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

You may be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password. For the password, you'll need to use a personal access token instead of your regular password. You can create one at https://github.com/settings/tokens.
